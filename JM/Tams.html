            <h1>TRIBE PAGEANT</h1>
            <p>
              The event start with an entrance ceremony showcasing every tribe of each program or school.
              The cheers are outstanding and bring the competition vibes in light. When we are in the hall
              waiting to go outside, it is kinda hot but the experience is definitely a treasure! We Represent
              T'boli tribe in color white (which is why we have white flags in representation and support to
              our candidates). Our candidates are wearing golf attire showcasing the white essence on their
              outfits. We are mixed of BMMA and IT students of first year in Marikina Campus. We in terms
              of cheer or chant, in my opinion, we have brought the soul of a true t'boli tribe. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You can see us in the pictures. Other than the pageant, Sinag Tamaraw is compact with fun
              and surprises!

            <h1>CONCERT EXPERIENCE</h1> <br>
            <p>The night concert was amazing! We are able to enjoy and genuinely have fun with the bands.
                It is so lit! I am inloved with sugarcane's performance! Their flutist was such a vibe! Despite of the technical issues, they were able to
                deliver a spectacular performance! worth the wait for being last. But what I enjoyed the most are the renditioned songs. It was such a blast!
                The front floor has become a party spot and that was indeed a youth experience! I could never not enjoyed that!</p> <br>
            <p>Here are some candid shots of the night. Feel the ambiance as you scroll in the gallery!</p>
