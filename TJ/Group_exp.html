        <h3>Group Experience While Doing This Project</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">Working on this project as a group was a truly collaborative and rewarding experience. 
        We brought together our unique skills and perspectives, allowing us to learn from one another and grow as 
        individuals and as a team. Throughout the process, we tackled challenges together, finding creative solutions 
        and supporting each other to overcome obstacles.</p>

       <h3>Ezequiel Nodalo</h3>
       <p class="E"> Building a website was a big challenge for me, but I am thankful for my companions, especially Timothy, who helped me along the way. This project taught me so much. I spent a lot of time watching YouTube videos to learn how HTML and CSS work. What I enjoyed the most was experimenting with different 
        layouts and seeing how my ideas came to life. The topics I worked on included the Pre-Christmas event, Life Lessons, the main landing page, Sinag Tamaraw, and the About Us section. I also created the header navbar and footer used on all the pages. Some of the layouts I designed were even used in other topics, 
        which made me proud. The hardest part of the process was working with JavaScript. It felt like a headache and a nightmare at times. Writing all the paragraphs for my topics without any AI assistance was also tough. It pushed my creativity to the limit, and I joked about how it probably fried many of my brain cells! 
        Despite the struggles, the experience was rewarding. I learned a lot and realized I love designing user interfaces. There’s still so much more to discover and improve, but this project has shown me how exciting and fulfilling web development can be. Looking back, the challenges were worth it because they helped me grow 
        and understand more about building websites. I am excited to keep learning and improving my skills in the future.

       <h3>Timothy Josh L. Dela Cruz</h3>
        <p class="T">The first part I worked on was "FEU Roosevelt Halloween Cos-Play." I used HTML and CSS for this section to create an impressive and stylish hovering animation. I also utilized CSS to properly layout the images and paragraphs, adding colors, text and photo shadows, and background effects.
            The second part I worked on was "Group Experience While Doing the Project." Similar to the first part, I used HTML and CSS for this section. I created a simple image grid layout to organize the images neatly, added a description, and styled the section with CSS, including an image background, proper layout, and text shadows.
            The third part I worked on was "Candid/Random Pictures." For this section, I again used HTML and CSS. I applied a custom font family to style the title, and I created a straightforward three-column grid layout to display our pictures. I also added a simple hovering animation with box shadows and an upscale effect.
            Lastly, the fourth part I worked on was "Sinag Sports." In this section, I mainly added images and descriptions. However, the overall design was borrowed from one of our group members, Ezequiel. My additional contribution was compiling all the work we did and attending events to capture the content pictures for the website.

        <h3>John Mark F. Cañete</h3>
        <p class="J">In our group project, I contributed by creating the webpage content for the Sinag Tamarraw, Go-to unwinding activities, and First-week college experience. Additionally, I cooperated with team members to make sure that we can finish our projects together. To further support the project, 
            I provided a few photos so that they can put in on their own website content.
        </p>
        <h3>Justine King Villasper</h3>
        <p class="V">I contributed to our project by brainstorming creative ideas and suggestions on the website's overall design and layout. I suggested a Far Eastern University looking interface by using a lot of green color around the webpage. Sharing the concepts for the color scheme and the images 
            ensures that the website will aligned with our target audience's preferences. This makes the user know that it is still connected with our school theme and it will easily catch their attentions and interest. Finally, the input of color schemes and typography around the web aims to create a clean 
            and professional look, making sure that it gets the user attention while mainting its functionality.
