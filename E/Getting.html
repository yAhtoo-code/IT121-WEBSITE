          <p>
            I am Ezequiel Nodalo or you may call me Kiel as well. First year (freshmen), 20 years old from
            Antipolo, Rizal. I took the course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology as it was close to
            my heart and I am driven by passion in the innovative world. I am quite challenged to build this
            website and I enjoy the learning curves of this experience. FEU Roosevelt is indeed a fascinating
            learning institution. With all the campus events, social interactions, and every friends I have made
            this year, I never regret becoming a tamaraw. I am hoping for a better future that awaits us. I believe
            we are just getting started.
