        <h2>Life Lessons by Tim</h2>
        <p>
            One of the things I’ve learned in life as a college freshman is to not be afraid to try new things.
            Being in my first year, I’m still exploring the things I’m capable of doing. Secondly, I always
            give my best in everything I do so that, in the end, I won’t have any regrets. I’ve also stopped
            stressing too much about my grades because I know in my heart that I’ve done my best to
            achieve good results. <br> <br>
            
            Another lesson I’ve learned is to not let myself get consumed by academic pressure and
            overthinking. During the first semester, I realized that it’s better to enjoy each day at school
            instead of focusing too much on academics to the point where I no longer find joy in what I
            do. <br> <br>
            
            Lastly, I’ve learned to just keep trying in everything I do because I believe that all the effort I
            put in now will benefit me in the future. I also hold onto the belief that when things get tough,
            it means I’m on the right track. I remind myself that failure doesn’t truly exist as long as I keep
            working hard and never give up.

        <h2>Freshie Experience by Ezequiel</h2>
        <p>
          Same as the usual school set ups, iba't ibang klase ng mga tao yung kasama mo dito.
          Merong mga rich kids, may kaya lang, at yung mga gaya kong hikaos den sa buhay hahaha.
          Hindi uso dito yung competition sa klase. Sa college dapat marunong kang makisama sa lahat.
          Nagpapalawak ka ng influence kase sa college hindi ka mag susurvive mag isa. 
          Masaya ang first year! Mababait den yung mga profs namen saka marunong den sila makisama
          at umintinde ng mga college students. <br> <br>
          
          Marami akong natutunan as a college freshmen. Unlike in highschool na hands-on magturo ang
          mga teachers, sa college, finafacilitate nalang ng mga profs yung learning mga students. May mga
          nag tuturo parin naman na profs mostly major super great! Pero may mga profs den na binabantayan
          nalang yung learning growth ng mga students. Kaya sa college, bawal ang tamad. <br> <br>
          
          Lastly, sa college, hindi na parang bata na mahigpit per minute at nasa loob ka lang ng campus.
          In my experience, maluwag yung scheduling ng mga units so may mga vacant. Noon ansarap lumabas ng
          school in HS or elem. ngayon ikaw nalang den tatamarin gumala e hahaha! Pero masarap gumala kapag
          nagkakayayaan. Syempre mga matured individuals na kayo, hindi na mahirap makisama at mas masaya
          kase witty ang mga tao hahaha!Best advice I can share is learn time management efficiently.
          Yan ang isa sa mga best key para mapadali ang buhay mo in college. That's all!

          <p>College is a journey filled with challenges, growth, and countless opportunities to discover your
            strengths and passions. Remember, every step you take—big or small—brings you closer to your
            goals. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed at times; what matters is your resilience and willingness to
            keep going. Surround yourself with people who uplift you, take breaks to recharge, and
            celebrate your progress, no matter how small it seems. You are capable, talented, and brave
            enough to overcome any obstacle. Trust in your ability to rise, and know that this hard work will
            open doors to an incredible future. You've got this! <br> <br>
          
            Take God's word along your journey for your strength and guidance. Remember when He said in Deuteronomy 31:6: "Be strong and
            courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you

              <h2>Personal Learnings by Justine</h2>
              <p>
                There are a few things which college life has imparted to me. One of these is the importance of
                being independent and having responsibility for my deeds. After I joined college, I figured out
                how setting very specific goals fulfills the basis of achieving both academic and personal
                growth. After all, it helped me to strike a balance because it is always important to stay
                productive without being stressed out and that would really help with managing my stress.
                Most importantly, I learned that nothing amounts to anything if it is not worked hard for. With
                that, I had been able to go through hard times and reach personal growth and academics as
                enduringly as possible.
